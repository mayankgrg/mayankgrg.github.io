Hi, I’m Mayank Garg, a Master of Science student in Computer Science at New York University, currently pursuing my degree as a full-time student. Prior to this, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at JP Morgan, where I focused on building robust, scalable systems, and earlier honed my engineering skills at Goldman Sachs. I hold a strong academic foundation from NIT Trichy, which continues to shape my problem-solving mindset.

I’m deeply passionate about working at the intersection of software engineering, data, and machine learning, and I thrive on tackling complex challenges that push the boundaries of what’s possible. My mission is to leverage technology to build thoughtful, impactful solutions that create real and positive change in the world.
